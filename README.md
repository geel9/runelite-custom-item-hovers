# Custom Item Hovers
This plugin displays arbitrary custom hover text over items.

# Setting up the plugin
For now, you must create a folder somewhere on your device, which will hold your hover files.

Once you've created the folder, copy its full path into the "Hover File Directory" config setting on RuneLite.

The plugin will read all of the hover files in the specified directory.

# Hover File
A Hover File is simply a JSON file.

See the `examples` folder for the format.
