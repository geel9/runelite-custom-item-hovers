# Custom Item Hovers
This plugin displays arbitrary custom hover text over items.

# Setting up the plugin
Upon first launch, the plugin will create a `customitemhovers` folder in your `.runelite` directory, which is usually located in your `HOME` directory.

For example, on Windows, this might be `C:/Users/{username}/.runelite/customitemhovers`

Place your hover files in this folder. To start, you can copy over the files in the `examples` folder of this repo.

## Easily Navigating to your Hover File Directory

To quickly open the directory containing your hover files, simply execute the configurable chat command to do so.

By default, this is `::openhoverdir`, but this can be changed via plugin config.
